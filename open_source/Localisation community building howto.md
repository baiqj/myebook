Tips & Tricks on how to get translators involved in a translation sprint

* Invite the community and your users (clients, partners, etc.) to a code sprint. It may be in an office, coffee shop, etc., as long as it has a * reliable wifi or network connection.
* Make sure everyone has a computer/laptop.
* Provide coffee, food, etc.
* Provide instructions in advance on how to use Transifex (and plan a bit of time at the beginning to make sure everyone has an account).
* Present the 'translator resources' aka 'glossary' in the wiki (create one in advance if there isn't one already), discuss terms which do not * * have concensus. This is a very important step that must be done before starting any translation.
* Discuss terms that may need to be added to the glossary.
* If necessary, demo the new features that will have to be translated.
* Explain to people how to find a string in the interface (ex: the link between CRM/Contact/Form/... and the actual URL in a demo site).
* Determine goals: what components to translate, to what percentage, etc.
* Split the work between translators: different translators can each work on a different component.
* Clearly designate a person who can be interrupted regularly in order to answer questions.
* At the end of the day, present the resulting translation in a demo CiviCRM installation.
* Discuss whether the team has achieved the goal, how to improve further.
* Help improve this documentation (wink)
* Tips & Tricks on how to get translators involved online:

* As a maintainer, maintain a presence online: inform the translators of the priorities by posting regularly in the Transifex forums (roadmap of * upcoming releases/string freeze, areas in the translation that need to be reviewed or improved)
* Make calls for volunteers in the CiviCRM forums.
* Blog about the translation progress or announce translation sprints on the CiviCRM blog
* Show your users/clients/partners how to use the online translation tools.
* Use the language / country CiviCRM site if there is one (such as civicrm.nl, civicrm.pl etc.) or consider starting it if there isn't
